# MFCC Benchmark

a simple python module for comparing the various libraries for speech preprocessing. Primarily used in the development of [speechsauce](https://github.com/secretsauceai/mfcc-rust) (name pending, please suggest literally anything else)

## Getting Started

setting up the virtual environment is pretty seamless if you have poetry installed:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/skewballfox/mfcc-benchmark
cd mfcc-benchmark
poetry install
poetry shell
```

then to run

```shell
python -m mfcc_bench
```

benchmark still a WIP
